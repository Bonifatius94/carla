      doc: >
        This will show which collisions were recorded in the file. We can use a filter for the collisions we want, using two categories.
        The categories can be:  
          'h' = Hero  
          'v' = Vehicle  
          'w' = Walker  
          't' = Traffic light  
          'o' = Other  
          'a' = Any  
        So, if you want to see only collisions about a vehicle and a walker, we would use for category1 'v' and category2 'w'.
        Or if you want all the collisions (filter off) you can use 'a' as both categories.

          How many centimeters needs to move the actor in order to be considered as moving, and not blocked
      doc: >
        Shows which actors seem blocked by some reason.
        The idea is to calculate which actors are not moving as much as 'min_distance' for a period of 'min_time'.
        By default min_time = 60 seconds (1 min) and min_distance = 100 centimeters (1 m).

  - class_name: TrafficManager
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The traffic manager is a module built on top of the CARLA API in C++. It handles any group of vehicles set to autopilot mode to populate the simulation with realistic urban traffic conditions and give the chance to user to customize some behaviours. The architecture of the traffic manager is divided in five different goal-oriented stages and a PID controller where the information flows until eventually, a carla.VehicleControl is applied to every vehicle registered in a traffic manager.  

      In order to learn more, visit the [documentation](adv_traffic_manager.md) regarding this module.

      params:
      - param_name: commands
        type: list
        doc: >
          A list of commands to execute in batch. For a list of commands available see function above apply_batch().
      return: list
      doc: >
        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation
        step, blocks until the commands are executed, and returns a list of
        [`command.Response`](#command.Response) that can be used to determine whether a single
        command succeeded or not.

=======
        Sets the difference the vehicle's intended speed and its current speed limit. Speed limits can be exceeded by setting the `perc` to a negative value.  

        Default is 30. Exceeding a speed limit can be done using negative percentages.

    - def_name: get_port
      params:
      return: uint16
      doc: >
        Returns the port where the Traffic Manager is connected. If the object is a TM-Client, it will return the port of its TM-Server. Read the [documentation](#adv_traffic_manager.md#multiclient-and-multitm-management) to learn the difference.

        default: False
        doc: >
          If __True__, enables the hybrid physics. 
      doc: >
        Enables or disables the hybrid physics mode. In this mode, vehicle's farther than a certain radius from the ego vehicle will have their physics disabled. Computation cost will be reduced by not calculating vehicle dynamics. Vehicles will be teleported.

      params:
      - param_name: r
        type: float

        doc: >
          New radius where physics are enabled. 
      doc: >
        With hybrid physics on, changes the radius of the area of influence where physics are enabled.

  - class_name: OpendriveGenerationParameters
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      This class defines the parameters used when generating a world using an OpenDRIVE file.
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: vertex_distance
      type: float
      doc: >
        Distance between vertices of the mesh generated. __Default is `2.0`__.
    - var_name: max_road_length
      type: float
      doc: >
        Max road length for a single mesh portion. The mesh of the map is divided into portions, in order to avoid propagating issues. __Default is `50.0`__.
    - var_name: wall_height
      type: float
      doc: >
        Height of walls created on the boundaries of the road. These prevent vehicles from falling off the road. __Default is `1.0`__.
    - var_name: additional_width
      type: float
      doc: >
        Additional with applied junction lanes. Complex situations tend to occur at junctions, and a little increase can prevent vehicles from falling off the road.  __Default is `0.6`__.
    - var_name: smooth_junctions
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the mesh at junctions will be smoothed to prevent issues where roads blocked other roads. __Default is `True`__.
    - var_name: enable_mesh_visibility
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the road mesh will be rendered. Setting this to __False__ should reduce the rendering overhead.  __Default is `True`__.
