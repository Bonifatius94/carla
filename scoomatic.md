# How to use the Scoomatic

Build carla **0.9.13** on linux according to their documentation online.

After `./Update.sh` to download the assets, carla will remove the pulled scoomatic files.
Downloading the assets is not accumulative, but instead the whole content folder will be replaced.
Therefore, you have to revert the changes after downloading the assets.
Due to the complex ignore structure, the scoomatic is now included in the logic repository of carla.

Ask @ll7 for the following files if you want a vehicle on your own
