# Dockerized CARLA Build

## About

This tutorial shows how to build the CARLA simulator with Docker.

## Prerequisites

### Machine Setup and Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Free Disk Space: | ~ 200-300 GB (yes, it's no joke) |
| Available RAM:   | 16 GB (clang runs out of memory with only 8 GB) |
| CPU:             | as many cores as possible, you'll need them |
| Suggested OS:    | Ubuntu 18.04 (because of Python 3.6) |

### Unreal Engine GitHub Access

1) Register as Unreal developer to access the Unreal Engine GitHub repositories, see this [official EPIC tutorial](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github)
2) Create a GitHub personal access token for login (pull the Unreal Engine repo),
see [official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

### OS Setup

Install the latest updates.

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
reboot
```

### Install Docker with NVIDIA GPU Support

1) Choose a **proprietary** NVIDIA driver (don't waste time with the open source one!!!)

2) Execute following commands to install Docker with GPU support

```sh
# install cURL, Docker and Docker-Compose
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl docker.io docker-compose

# register the NVIDIA Docker PPA as apt source
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
    && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
    && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list \
        | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

# install NVIDIA Docker from the official NVIDIA PPA
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2

# disable the swap partition. be smart, don't kill your disk :)
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab && sudo mount -a

# allow non-root users to work with Docker (requires a reboot)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && reboot
```

## Build Steps

This section shows how to build the CARLA repository with Docker.

### Clone the CARLA Source Code

Clone the Source Code and download the assets:

```sh
CARLA_REPO=https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla
CARLA_BRANCH=master

git clone $CARLA_REPO --depth=1 -b $CARLA_BRANCH
cd carla
./Update.sh
```

### Build UE4 Build Environment Docker Image

Run following commands to build the CARLA simulator.
The build will take several hours, even on powerful machines.

```sh
GITHUB_USERNAME=....
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=....

docker build -t carla-prerequisites \
    --build-arg EPIC_USER=$GITHUB_USERNAME \
    --build-arg EPIC_PASS=$GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN \
    -f Util/Docker/Prerequisites.Dockerfile .
```

### Use Local Carla UE4 Development Tools With Docker

For local development, you would often require the CARLAUE4Editor
for integrating custom Unreal assets, etc. This workflow is also
encapsulated within a dockerized build environment as follows.

First, build the Docker image used as build environment:

```sh
docker build -f Util/Docker/Localbuildenv.Dockerfile . -t carla-localbuildenv:latest
```

Now, you can spin a build environment up using Docker-Compose.
It mounts the locally checked-out Git repository into the
container and executes commands like e.g. "make launch":

```sh
docker-compose -f build-compose.yml run carla-build-machine <your command>
docker-compose -f build-compose.yml run carla-build-machine make launch
```

As we've added GPU support to the build environment, the CarlaUE4Editor
will show up on the host machine while still running within the container.
So, you can basically use the build environment like a local source build,
but you don't have to care about toolchain setup anymore. Everything is
abstracted by Docker.

If you need to run more complex commands, you can also attach to the
container with an interactive bash session, see following command:

```sh
docker-compose -f build-compose.yml run carla-build-machine bash
```

### Build Carla Simulator Docker Image

For releasing the simulator as Docker image, run following command.

```sh
docker build -t carla:latest -f Util/Docker/Carla.Dockerfile .
```

Check if the carla:latest image exists (should be an image of ~ 16GB size)

```sh
docker image ls | grep 'carla'
```

## Example Usage

### Launch Simulator

Now that the build completed, you can launch the CARLA simulator
as headless, GPU-empowered backend service.

```sh
docker run --privileged --gpus all \
    --net=host -e 2000-2002 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
    --name carla_sim carla:latest
```

### Spawn + Remote-Control a Vehicle via PythonAPI

Copy the PythonAPI from the simulator instance onto the host machine.

```sh
mkdir temp
docker cp carla_sim:/home/carla/PythonAPI ./temp/
cd temp
```

Register the _carla_ package in the _PYTHONPATH_ and make sure it can be imported.

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/PythonAPI/carla:$PWD/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.13-py3.6-linux-x86_64.egg

python3 -c 'import carla'
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo 'carla import successful!'; fi
```

Install _pygame_ to remote-control a vehicle via _PythonAPI/examples/manual_control.py_.

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade
python3 -m pip install numpy pygame
```

List all available vehicles.

```py
import carla

client = carla.Client('localhost', 2000)
world = client.get_world()

vehicle_blueprints = world.get_blueprint_library().filter('*vehicle*')
print('all vehicles:', vehicle_blueprints)
```

Spawn a new vehicle and control it via the keyboard.

```sh
python3 PythonAPI/examples/manual_control.py [--filter <vehicle_to_spawn>]
```

### Shut Down Simulator

```sh
docker stop carla_sim'
```

## Other Useful Commands

Delete all dangling images and containers to free up your disk again.

```sh
docker container prune
docker image prune
```
